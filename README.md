# buzz-files
files relating to a project of mine. most of these files are just reuploads from my computer and aren't of any use.


This is project work for something, using using different speech recognition API's, I'm trying to make a live transcripter that writes a text file with timestamps with what you said. This is the goal, at least.
Could be used for enterprise purposes.
